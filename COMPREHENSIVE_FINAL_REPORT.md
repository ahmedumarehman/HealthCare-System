      {
        id: 'analytics',
        title: 'Clinical Analytics',
        component: <ClinicalAnalyticsWidget />,
        roles: ['doctor', 'researcher', 'admin']
      },
      // Additional dashboard widgets...
    ].filter(widget => widget.roles.includes(userRole));
  }, [userRole]);
  
  // Dashboard layout and rendering...
};
```

### 5.2 Patient Dashboard & Records Interface

#### Purpose of the Patient Dashboard
The Patient Dashboard serves as the centralized hub for healthcare providers to access, analyze, and manage comprehensive patient information. The primary purposes of this dashboard include:

1. **Holistic Patient View**: Consolidates fragmented medical records from multiple sources (hospitals, clinics, specialists) into a unified, chronological view of the patient's complete health history.

2. **Clinical Decision Support**: Provides physicians with critical information at the point of care, highlighting relevant medical history, allergies, medications, and potential drug interactions to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

3. **Preventive Care Management**: Identifies gaps in preventive care through automated flagging of overdue screenings, vaccinations, and follow-up appointments based on demographic factors and risk profiles.

4. **Treatment Monitoring**: Enables real-time tracking of patient response to treatments through visualized trends in vital signs, lab results, and patient-reported outcomes.

5. **Care Coordination**: Facilitates seamless coordination between healthcare providers by making shared care plans, specialist notes, and treatment protocols easily accessible to the entire care team.

6. **Patient Engagement**: Includes a patient portal component allowing individuals to view their own medical information, schedule appointments, request prescription refills, and communicate securely with providers.

#### Implementation Details
Comprehensive patient data visualization:

```typescript
// src/components/Dashboard/PatientRecords.tsx
const PatientRecords: React.FC<PatientRecordsProps> = ({ patientId }) => {
  // Fetch patient data with security context
  const { data, loading, error } = usePatientData(patientId);
  
  // Timeline visualization of patient history
  const renderMedicalTimeline = () => {
    return (
      <MedicalTimeline
        events={data.medicalEvents}
        highlightConditions={data.chronicConditions}
        medications={data.medications}
        annotations={data.doctorNotes}
      />
    );
  };
  
  // Additional patient record visualization...
};
```

#### Key Dashboard Components
The patient dashboard implements several specialized modules:

1. **Clinical Summary**: Snapshot of current health status, active problems, allergies, and vital trends
2. **Medication Management**: Current medications, adherence tracking, refill status, and interaction checking
3. **Diagnostic Timeline**: Chronological visualization of diagnoses, procedures, and hospital encounters
4. **Laboratory Results**: Trending of lab values with reference ranges and critical value highlighting
5. **Imaging & Documents**: Thumbnail access to medical images, procedure reports, and clinical notes
6. **Care Plan Tracker**: Visual representation of treatment protocols and progress toward health goals

#### User Experience Considerations
The dashboard was designed with extensive input from healthcare providers to ensure:
- Critical information appears "above the fold" without scrolling
- Color-coding highlights abnormal values and urgent items
- Responsive design adapts to various screen sizes and devices used in clinical settings
- Information density is optimized to prevent cognitive overload while providing comprehensive data
- Customizable views allow different specialists to prioritize relevant information

    const aggregatedData = await analyticsService.aggregateData(parameters, {
      privacyLevel: 'differential-privacy',
      epsilon: 0.1
    });
    
    // Generate visualizations
    return reportGenerator.createReport(aggregatedData, parameters.visualizationPreferences);
  };
  
  // Dashboard components and controls...
};
```

### 5.4 Security Monitoring Interface
Real-time security monitoring dashboard:

```typescript
// Security dashboard for system administrators
const SecurityDashboard: React.FC = () => {
  // Real-time security metrics and alerts
